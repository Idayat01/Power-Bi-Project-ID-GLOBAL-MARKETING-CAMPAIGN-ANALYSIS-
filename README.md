# Marketing Campaign Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)  

ID GLOBAL is a company that runs digital 
marketing campaigns across different channels: Email, Instagram Ads, 
Influencer Marketing, and more. In this project I built a fully interactive 
dashboard to monitor campaign performance and help optimize future 
strategies. I built a clean, professional dashboard that 
clearly communicates key insights and allows for dynamic filtering across 
campaigns, dates, products, and marketing channels.
